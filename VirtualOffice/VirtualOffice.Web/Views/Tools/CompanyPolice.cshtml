                        <p><b>MONTHLY VISITS TO RETAIL SITES</b></p>

                            Distributor must visit each retail location at least once per month to check that the following is in order:<br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Distributor must deliver and display current marketing materials related to POS and/or its existing products and services in a visible location in the store. This includes the most recent posters, decals, counter mats, and other marketing items supplied to the distributor by Blackstone.</li>
                            
                            <li>Distributor must ensure that there is an adequate supply of blank paper stock at the retail location at all times.</li>
                            
                            <li>Distributor must check each terminal&#146;s product mix and ensure that it is programmed with a product mix that best suits the retailer&#146;s market and its customers. If a new product mix is desired, the Distributor will assist the retailer in selecting the best possible products for the location and will complete the necessary applications in order to make the changes effective. Product Profile change forms must then be sent to Blackstone by the distributor for approval and reconfiguration in our system.</li>
                            
                            <li>Distributor must use the LOGON feature in the terminal to indicate with their unique code and password that the Distributor serviced the retail location as per the items listed in this document.</li>

                            <li>If a terminal is to lose its program load as a result of power failure or other unforeseen circumstances, the distributor agrees to assist Blackstone in performing a new program load at the retail location.</li>
